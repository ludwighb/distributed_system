3. early exit test. coordinator need to assume the worker is dead after waiting for 10 seconds. 


To test crash recovery, you can use the mrapps/crash.go application plugin. It randomly exits in the Map and Reduce functions.

To ensure that nobody observes partially written files in the presence of crashes, the MapReduce paper mentions the trick of using a temporary file and atomically renaming it once it is completely written. You can use ioutil.TempFile to create a temporary file and os.Rename to atomically rename it.

test-mr-many.sh provides a bare-bones script for running test-mr.sh with a timeout (which is how we'll test your code). It takes as an argument the number of times to run the tests. You should not run several test-mr.sh instances in parallel because the coordinator will reuse the same socket, causing conflicts.
