Fill in the RequestVoteArgs and RequestVoteReply structs. Modify Make() to create a background goroutine that will kick off leader election periodically by sending out RequestVote 
RPCs when it hasn't heard from another peer for a while. This way a peer will learn who is the leader, if there is already a leader, or become the leader itself. 
Implement the RequestVote() RPC handler so that servers will vote for one another.


Leader Election: 

1. SendVoteRequest
2. GetVoteRequest
3. Test Initial Election. 
4. Leader send heartbeat. 


Caveat
1. heartbeat < 0.1 times/seconds
2. new leader choosen < 5 seconds
